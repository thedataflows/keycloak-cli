# keycloak-cli

A Go CLI for declarative Keycloak administration. It speaks the Keycloak Admin REST API through an OpenAPI contract, so every operation is validated against the spec before it hits the wire. Endpoints are not hard-coded; they are deduced from the supplied OpenAPI spec, so passing a different Keycloak spec lets the CLI use the appropriate endpoints for any resource the spec describes.

The tool loads manifest files (JSON or YAML), validates them against the Keycloak OpenAPI spec (bundled at `keycloak-oapi/26.6.2.spec.json` by default, overridable with `--spec-path`), and applies them via the Admin REST API. It can also fetch live state, compare it with local manifests, generate test fixtures, and manage admin tokens.

## How it works

1. **OpenAPI contract** — At startup the CLI loads the Keycloak Admin REST OpenAPI spec (`--spec-path`). Every resource type, operation path, request schema, and path parameter is derived from the spec, so the tool adapts to whichever Keycloak OpenAPI document you provide.
2. **Resource mapping** — The CLI discovers CRUD operations per resource type (`realm`, `user`, `client`, `group`, `role`, etc.) by scanning the spec. It builds an internal routing table so `POST /admin/realms/{realm}/users` is used for creating users, `PUT /admin/realms/{realm}/users/{user-id}` for updates, and so on.
3. **Validation** — Before any network call, resources and relationships are validated against the spec schemas and operation contracts.
4. **Dependency ordering** — Resources are sorted by dependency (realms first, then users, groups, roles, clients, etc.) so uploads succeed without manual ordering.
5. **Relationship extraction** — The CLI can fetch and export relationships (user-group memberships, role composites, client scopes, etc.) by walking the live API state.
6. **Round-trip comparison** — The `compare` command canonicalizes both local manifests and fetched state (stripping server-managed fields) and performs subset-based comparison.

## Features

- **Spec-aware validation** — Resources and relationships are validated against the Keycloak OpenAPI spec before apply.
- **Dynamic resource discovery** — New resource types available in the spec are automatically supported for fetch and apply without code changes.
- **Relationship validation** — Relationship operations are matched against the admin API contract using path template inference.
- **Fetch with relationship export** — Pull live state including user-group memberships, role composites, client scope mappings, federated identities, and organization links.
- **Canonicalized fetch** — Strip server-managed fields to produce a clean manifest suitable for re-apply.
- **Manifest generation** — Generate test realms with configurable counts of users, clients, roles, groups, organizations, identity providers, client scopes, authentication flows, password policies, and security defenses.
- **Round-trip comparison** — Compare local manifests with live Keycloak state through normalized resource and relationship state.
- **Dry-run uploads** — Validate and preview changes without sending them.
- **Continue-on-error** — Apply as many resources as possible even when individual items fail.
- **Admin token retrieval** — Password-grant flow with automatic `.env` storage.
- **Integration stack** — Docker Compose stack for local Keycloak testing via `mise`.

## Build

```bash
go build .
```

This produces a `keycloak-cli` binary in the current directory. Once built (or installed on your `PATH`), use it directly:

```bash
keycloak-cli --help
```

### `admin-token`

Get an admin access token through the password grant flow.

```bash
# Default: admin/admin on master realm, store to .env
keycloak-cli admin-token

# Custom credentials
keycloak-cli admin-token --username admin --password admin --realm master

# Print token only, do not write .env
keycloak-cli admin-token --set-env=false
```

### `version`

Print the CLI version.

```bash
keycloak-cli version
```

## Supported resources

Resource types are discovered dynamically from the OpenAPI spec. The CLI does not maintain a hard-coded list of endpoints; instead it scans the spec, creates a contract for every resource type with recognizable CRUD operations, and uses the appropriate endpoint for each request. Common types discovered from the bundled Keycloak 26.6.2 spec include:

| Resource type             | Typical operations     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `realm`                   | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `user`                    | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `client`                  | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `group`                   | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `role`                    | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `clientscope`             | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `component`               | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `identityprovider`        | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `organization`            | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `authenticationflow`      | GET, POST, PUT         |
| `authenticationexecution` | GET                    |
| `protocolmapper`          | GET, POST, PUT         |
| `identityprovidermapper`  | GET, POST, PUT         |
| `requiredactionprovider`  | GET, PUT               |
| `clientpolicies`          | GET, PUT               |
| `clientprofiles`          | GET, PUT               |
| `localization`            | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| `workflow`                | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |

Additional types—such as `resource`, `scope`, `policy`, `credential`, `event`, and any new types introduced in a future spec—are supported automatically through dynamic operation mapping.

## Supported relationships

Relationship families are inferred from the admin API contract by scanning relationship-like paths in the OpenAPI spec; a built-in registry supplies friendly names and payload shapes for the most common patterns. Both fetch and apply are supported for the following families:

| Relationship                       | Description                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `user-group-membership`            | User group memberships               |
| `user-realm-role-mapping`          | User realm role mappings             |
| `user-client-role-mapping`         | User client role mappings            |
| `user-federated-identity`          | User federated identity links        |
| `group-realm-role-mapping`         | Group realm role mappings            |
| `group-client-role-mapping`        | Group client role mappings           |
| `role-composite-mapping`           | Realm role composite memberships     |
| `client-role-composite`            | Client role composite memberships    |
| `client-scope-realm-role-mapping`  | Client scope to realm role mappings  |
| `client-scope-client-role-mapping` | Client scope to client role mappings |
| `client-realm-scope-mapping`       | Client realm scope mappings          |
| `client-client-scope-mapping`      | Client to client scope mappings      |
| `default-group-membership`         | Realm default groups                 |
| `realm-default-client-scope`       | Realm default client scopes          |
| `realm-optional-client-scope`      | Realm optional client scopes         |
| `client-default-scope`             | Client default scope mappings        |
| `client-optional-scope`            | Client optional scope mappings       |
| `organization-member`              | Organization member assignments      |
| `organization-identity-provider`   | Organization identity provider links |

New relationship patterns that appear in a different Keycloak spec can be picked up automatically or customized with a `relationship-overrides.yaml` file next to the spec.

## Manifest format

### Resource manifest

A resource manifest is a JSON or YAML array of resource objects.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "realm",
    "realm": "demo",
    "data": {
      "realm": "demo",
      "enabled": true,
      "displayName": "Demo Realm"
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "user",
    "realm": "demo",
    "data": {
      "username": "alice",
      "enabled": true,
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "client",
    "realm": "demo",
    "data": {
      "clientId": "my-app",
      "name": "My Application",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
]
```

Fields:

- `type` — Resource type (must match a type discoverable from the spec).
- `realm` — Target realm name.
- `data` — The resource payload. Must conform to the schema for the resource type and operation.
- `parentType` — Optional. Disambiguates the parent resource type for nested resources (e.g. a `protocolmapper` under a `clientscope` vs a `client`).
- `delete` — If `true`, the resource is deleted instead of created/updated.

### Relationship manifest

Relationship manifests use a `relationships` envelope.

```json
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "path": "demo/users/alice/groups/admin-group"
    },
    {
      "path": "demo/users/alice/role-mappings/realm",
      "data": [
        { "name": "admin-role" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "path": "demo/roles-by-id/admin-role/composites",
      "data": [
        { "name": "composite-role" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Relationship paths are resolved against the actual spec templates discovered from the OpenAPI document. The example paths above match templates such as `{realm}/users/{user-id}/groups/{groupId}`, `{realm}/users/{user-id}/role-mappings/realm`, and `{realm}/roles-by-id/{role-id}/composites`. The CLI validates each path and payload against the spec operation contract.

### Loading manifests

Manifests can be loaded from files or directories. The CLI accepts both JSON and YAML formats.

```bash
# Single file
keycloak-cli upload realm.json

# Directory (loads all `.json` and `.yaml` files)
keycloak-cli upload generated/

# Multiple files
keycloak-cli upload realm.json relationships.json
```

## Environment setup

The CLI loads `.env`, `.local.env`, and `.development.env` if they exist.

Useful variables:

| Variable                      | Description                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL`           | Keycloak server URL                          |
| `KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_TOKEN`       | Bearer token for authenticated requests      |
| `KEYCLOAK_REFRESH_TOKEN`      | Refresh token for token renewal              |
| `KEYCLOAK_USERNAME`           | Admin username for token command             |
| `KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD`           | Admin password for token command             |
| `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` | Alternative admin username for token command |
| `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Alternative admin password for token command |
| `KEYCLOAK_REALM`              | Default realm for token command              |

Values in `.env` take precedence over inherited environment variables, so an `admin-token` run that updates `.env` is immediately picked up by the next command.

Example `.env`:

```bash
KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL=http://keycloak.172.21.0.3.nip.io:8080
KEYCLOAK_USERNAME=admin
KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin
KEYCLOAK_REALM=master
```

## Local integration stack

A Docker Compose stack is available for local Keycloak testing. Tasks are managed with [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

Start:

```bash
mise run integration:up
# or
bash mise-tasks/integration/up.sh
```

Test:

```bash
mise run integration:test
# or
bash mise-tasks/integration/test.sh
```

Stop:

```bash
mise run integration:down
# or
bash mise-tasks/integration/down.sh
```

The stack reads `KEYCLOAK_VERSION`, `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME`, and `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`.

## Updating the OpenAPI spec

Download a new Keycloak OpenAPI spec:

```bash
KEYCLOAK_VERSION=26.6.2 mise run generate:oapi
```

Force overwrite an existing spec:

```bash
KEYCLOAK_VERSION=26.6.2 mise run generate:oapi -- --force
```

## Development

Run tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run vet:

```bash
go vet ./...
```

Run linter:

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

Format code:

```bash
go fmt ./...
```

## Architecture

  internal/   — Runtime HTTP client & resource operation mapping
auth/         — Token acquisition and .env storage
catalog/      — OpenAPI spec parsing, contracts, validation, relationships
manifest/     — Resource/relationship parsing, loading, comparison
output/       — Table/JSON/YAML/TOML formatting

keycloak-oapi/ — Bundled Keycloak OpenAPI specs
```

## Current scope

The CLI does not hard-code Keycloak endpoints. It deduces resource types, CRUD operations, and relationship patterns directly from the supplied OpenAPI spec. In principle, any Keycloak Admin REST OpenAPI document can be passed with `--spec-path`, and the CLI will dynamically discover the appropriate endpoints for the requested resources. The contract layer, validation path, relationship export, round-trip normalization, and compare flow are spec-driven and do not require code changes when Keycloak adds new resource types.
